JavaScript DataTypes
* Primitive dataTypes
* Non-Primitive dataTypes

Primitive DataTypes:
    * Number
    * String
    * Boolean
    * Null
    * Undefined

Non-Primitive DataTypes:
    * Array
    * Object

There are two types of memory allocation:
    * Static memory allocation - Stack memory
    * Dynamic memory allocation - Heap memory

Stack Memory:
    * Primitive dataTypes are stored in Stack memory.
    * Stack memory are easy to access.
    * They are immutable, meaning cannot be changed.

    For a primitive dataType a reference variable is created and points to a address,
    where the value is stored in stack memory.

Heap Memory:
    * Non-Primitive dataTypes are stored in Heap memory.
    * Compared to Stack memory, Heap memory is little slow to access.
    * They are mutable, meaning are subject to change.

    For a Non-primitive dataType a reference variable is created and,
    where reference variable points to a head memory address.
