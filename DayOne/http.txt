HTTP 1.1 Vs HTTP 2

HTTP 1
    HTTP stands for HyperText transfer protocol. 
    It is the application protocol that communicates between client and
    server via internet. The first version of HTTP was released by 
    Tim Berners Lee in 1996.

    limitations:
    * Before each request a connection using Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) was first
        established to the server.
        TCP connection => For a single TCP connection
            * First client will initiate a request to the server.
            * Then server will send back a response connection with acknowledgement to client.
            * Then the client will send the confirmation of the acknowledgement to the server.
    
    * Ordering the requests, for a single page to load. For a single page to load there were
        many request needs to be send to the server.

HTTP 1.1
    In HTTP 1.1 resolved lot of limitations provided by HTTP 1 and
    was release in 1997 by Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF).
    * Keep Alive connection is new feature introduced to avoid establishing multiple connections
        to the same server, before requesting for files.
    * Now a browser can have a maximum of 6 TCP connection to servers.
    * Ordering for requests for multiple files, instead of sending it as each request
        after a connection is established.
    
HTTP 2
    In HTTP 2 simplified the overall process, was released by IETF in 2015.
